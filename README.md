# bdsLogging
A PowerShell logging module

I just needed an extendable module to add various logging options to some scripts.

I'm trying to work this module where each new logging type can just "plug in" - 
all options for the various "new logging types" are contained in the new logging
file, and adding a new logging file automatically adds it to the config.

It's early yet.
